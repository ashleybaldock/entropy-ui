# A Chaotic React UI Component Library

See: https://entropy-ui.netlify.app/ for Storybook/demo.


## Building

`npm run build`

Peer dependencies on React and ReactDOM, but that's about it.


## Using

`npm install entropy-ui`

`import { FlexRow, Button } from 'entropy-ui';`

See the demo for doc snippets (WIP).
